============================
 Invenio v1.1.6 is released
============================

Invenio v1.1.6 was released on May 21, 2015.

About
-----

Invenio is a digital library framework enabling you to build your own
digital library or document repository on the web.

This old stable release update is recommended to all Invenio sites
using v1.1.5 or previous releases.

Security fixes
--------------

+ WebStyle:

  - Adds back the `HttpOnly` cookie attribute in order to better
    protect against potential XSS vulnerabilities.  (#3064)

Improved features
-----------------

+ installation:

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIDaemonProcess` user value, taken from the configuration
    variable `CFG_BIBSCHED_PROCESS_USER`, provided it is set.  This
    change makes it easier to run Invenio under non-Apache user
    identity.

  - Apache virtual environments are now created with appropriate
    `WSGIPythonHome` directive so that it would be easier to run
    Invenio from within Python virtual environments.

Bug fixes
---------

+ global:

  - Replaces `invenio-demo.cern.ch` by `demo.invenio-software.org`
    which is the new canonical URL of the demo site.  (#2867)

+ testutils:

  - Switches off SSL verification when running the test suite.  Useful
    for Python-2.7.9 where self-signed SSL certificates (that are
    usually used on development installations) would cause apparent
    test failures.  (#2868)

Installation

Please follow the INSTALL file bundled in the distribution tarball.

Upgrade
-------

Please proceed as follows:

a) Stop your bibsched queue and your Apache server.

b) Install the update::

     $ tar xvfz invenio-1.1.6.tar.gz
     $ cd invenio-1.1.6
     $ sudo rsync -a /opt/invenio/etc/ /opt/invenio/etc.OLD/
     $ sh /opt/invenio/etc/build/config.nice
     $ make
     $ make check-upgrade
     $ sudo -u www-data make install
     $ sudo rsync -a /opt/invenio/etc.OLD/ \
         --exclude invenio-autotools.conf \
         /opt/invenio/etc/ # (1)
     $ sudo -u www-data /opt/invenio/bin/inveniocfg --update-all
     $ sudo -u www-data /opt/invenio/bin/inveniocfg --upgrade

     (1) If you are upgrading from previous stable release series
         (v0.99 or v1.0), please don't run this rsync command but
         diff, in order to inspect changes and adapt your old
         configuration to the new Invenio v1.1 release series.

c) Restart your Apache server and your bibsched queue.

Happy hacking and thanks for flying Invenio.
