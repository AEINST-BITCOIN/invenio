 Sprinting
===========

::

    Ah, unfinished issues!
    All that remains
    Of the Scrum Master dreams.
       â€”-after Matsuo Basho (1644-1694)

Sprinting principles
====================

1. **Before planning a sprint, do your homework.** Start by drafting initial
   thoughts about high-level requirements and use cases in an RFC. Be specific.

   i. About
   ii. Use cases
   iii. Mock-up screenshots
   iv. High-level architecture
   v. High-level API

2. **Discuss with various Invenio services and experts.** Check for other
   similar use cases and synergies. Use the community. Seek expert opinions.

3. **Establish a cross-service team.** "Alone we can do so little; together we
   can do so much." --Helen Keller

4. **Establish a backlog of tasks.** List everything that needs to be done. Keep
   it short. Use GitHub "Sprint-Foo" labels or milestones.

5. **Keep it manageable.** Plan no more than a two-week sprint. Break up longer
   sprints into manageable two-week chunks. Beware of attention span.
   Prioritise.

6. **Act.** Trying our best to finish all tasks in time? "No. Try not. Do. Or do
   not. There is no try." (--Master Yoda)

7. **Hold very short daily stand-up meetings.** What has everyone done since
   yesterday? Is anyone blocked by anything? What is everyone going to do next?

8. **Once over, review achievements.** Did everything go as planned? Were you
   too optimistic or too pessimistic regarding backlog and time planning? What
   have we learned?

9. **Finish by releasing the packages and deploying the features.** Close
   sprints by releasing the software and deploying the features on concerned
   services --- production or sandbox.
